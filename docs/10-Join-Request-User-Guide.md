  - The user's role will be automatically promoted from `Visitor` to `Admin`.
  - The user will receive a notification informing them that their request was approved.
  - They will now have access to all the bot's features for admins.

### 4. Rejecting a Request

- When you click **"‚ùå Reject"**:
  - The request will be marked as `rejected` in the system.
  - The user will be notified that their request was not approved.
